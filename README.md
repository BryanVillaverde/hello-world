# hello-world
My first ever repository


Hi, I am Bryan, an aspiring programmer. I like to learn a lot about programming so I can 
realign my career to become a programmer. My current work sucks because it is not IT related
even though I'm an IT Graduate. Hope other people could help me. My time is running out. LOL.
